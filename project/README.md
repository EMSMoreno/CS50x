#### DESCRIPTION:
Welcome to my CS50 Final Project. I did a Streaming Platform Simulation, which is a culmination of my learning journey through the CS50 course in partnership between edX and Harvard University. This project represents a fusion of creativity, technical skill and a passion for showcasing my diverse range of projects in a visually stunning and interactive manner.
At its core, this showcase leverages cutting-edge web development technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript to craft an immersive user experience. The incorporation of 3D animations adds an extra layer of depth and engagement, creating a memorable browsing experience for visitors.
One of the standout features of this project is the integration of Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime, which seamlessly interacts with an external API. By leveraging Node.js, I've been able to dynamically fetch and display movie data from an external source, enriching the streaming platform showcase with real-time content updates and enhancing its overall functionality.
When exploring the this streaming platform showcase, visitors will find themselves immersed in a curated selection of projects, presented in a manner reminiscent of popular streaming services like Netflix. Each project is meticulously crafted and presented, providing visitors with a glimpse into my skills, interests, and accomplishments.
As visitors navigate through the showcase, they have the opportunity to delve deeper into individual projects by clicking on movie or series representations. Behind the scenes, this action triggers a request to the database via the external API, fetching detailed information about the selected project and seamlessly integrating it into the locally hosted template.
This showcase is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experiences across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. Whether accessed on a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone, visitors can expect a consistent and engaging browsing experience.

#### STEPS TO OPEN THE PROJECT

1. Install node_modules.
2. Open VSCode Terminal and run the following command to start the server: `nodemon server.js`.
3. Open your favorite browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`.
4. Browse through the website to explore multiple movies and series, replicating an original streaming service experience.
5. Click on any movie or series to retrieve its corresponding data from the database via the external API. This allows for dynamic content loading within the locally created template.
6. The site is responsive, ensuring optimal viewing across different devices.
7. To close the website, simply use CTRL + C in the Terminal.

Enjoy exploring!
